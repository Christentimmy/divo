   - Proper call state listeners with native SDK
   - Incoming call detection and routing
   - Foreground service keeps app alive during calls

### 🎯 SDK 5.0+ Features

- **Automatic Iterate** - No manual core iterations needed
- **Foreground/Background Detection** - SDK handles app lifecycle automatically
- **Audio Focus Management** - Proper handling of system audio focus
- **Native Ringtone** - Uses device ringtone for incoming calls

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Step 1: Clean Build
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### Step 2: Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

### Step 3: Test Login
1. Open the app
2. Go to login screen
3. Enter your SIP credentials (currently hardcoded in `auth_controller.dart` line 49-52)
4. Watch the console logs:
   ```
   📡 Registration state: Progress, Message: ...
   📡 Registration state: Ok, Message: Registration successful
   ✅ Login successful
   ```

### Step 4: Test Outgoing Call
1. After successful login, go to dial screen
2. Enter a SIP address or phone number (e.g., `echo@sip.linphone.org`)
3. Press call button
4. Watch console logs:
   ```
   📞 Call state: OutgoingInit, Remote: sip:echo@sip.linphone.org, Direction: outgoing
   📞 Call state: OutgoingProgress, Remote: ...
   📞 Call state: Connected, Remote: ...
   📞 Call state: StreamsRunning, Remote: ...
   ```

### Step 5: Test Incoming Call
1. Have another SIP client call your registered address
2. The app should automatically navigate to call screen
3. Console shows:
   ```
   📞 Call state: IncomingReceived, Remote: sip:caller@domain.com, Direction: incoming
   ```

### Step 6: Test Call Controls
- **Mute/Unmute** - Toggle microphone during call
- **Speaker** - Toggle between earpiece and speaker
- **Hangup** - End the call

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### Check Registration State
You can query registration state at any time:
```dart
final state = await LinphoneService().getRegistrationState();
print('Current registration: $state');
```

### Monitor All Events
All call and registration events are logged with emojis:
- 📞 = Call state changes
- 📡 = Registration state changes
- ✅ = Success messages
- ❌ = Error messages
- ⚠️ = Warning messages

### Common Issues

**Issue: Build fails with "duplicate class" error**
- Solution: Run `flutter clean` and rebuild

**Issue: Registration fails with "Bad credentials"**
- Check username/password in `auth_controller.dart`
- Ensure SIP server address is correct (e.g., `sip.linphone.org`)

**Issue: Incoming calls not working**
- Ensure permissions are granted (microphone, camera, phone)
- Check if CoreService is running (logs will show service start)
- Verify your SIP account allows incoming calls

**Issue: No audio during call**
- Check microphone permission
- Try toggling speaker
- Verify echo cancellation is not causing issues

## 🎛️ Configuration Options

### Change SIP Server
In `auth_controller.dart`, modify the login parameters:
```dart
await _service.login(
  username: 'your_username',
  password: 'your_password',
  domain: 'your_sip_domain.com',  // Change this
);
```

### Enable Video Calls
Currently configured for audio-only. To enable video:

1. In `LinphoneManager.kt`, change line 161:
   ```kotlin
   params?.isVideoEnabled = true  // Change from false to true
   ```

2. Update SDK dependency in `build.gradle.kts`:
   ```kotlin
   implementation("org.linphone:linphone-sdk-android:5.3.+")
   // Already supports video, no change needed
   ```

### Adjust Audio Settings
In `LinphoneManager.kt` line 79-82:
```kotlin
core?.isEchoCancellationEnabled = true  // Disable if needed
core?.isAdaptiveRateControlEnabled = true
core?.isNativeRingingEnabled = true
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **Dynamic SIP Configuration**
   - Move credentials to user input instead of hardcoded values
   - Store credentials securely (e.g., flutter_secure_storage)

2. **Call History**
   - Implement call logging
   - Store call records locally

3. **Push Notifications**
   - Implement FCM for incoming calls when app is killed
   - Add push notification handling in CoreService

4. **UI Improvements**
   - Add accept/reject buttons for incoming calls
   - Show call duration timer
   - Add call quality indicators

5. **Video Call Support**
   - Enable video in call params
   - Add video preview widgets
   - Implement camera switching

6. **Contact Integration**
   - Link calls to contacts
   - Show contact name instead of SIP address

### Performance Optimization

- Consider using `linphone-sdk-android-audio-only` if you don't need video (~30MB vs ~50MB)
- Implement call quality monitoring
- Add network quality indicators

## 📝 Important Notes

### About the Old Plugin

You can now **remove** the old plugin from `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
# Remove this line:
linphone_flutter_plugin: ^0.0.2
```

However, I kept it for now to maintain backward compatibility. Once you verify everything works, you can remove it completely.

### SDK Updates

To update to a newer Linphone SDK version:
1. Open `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
2. Change line 44: `implementation("org.linphone:linphone-sdk-android:5.4.+")`
3. Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

### Production Considerations

Before deploying to production:
1. ✅ Remove hardcoded credentials from auth_controller.dart
2. ✅ Implement proper error handling and user feedback
3. ✅ Add analytics/crash reporting
4. ✅ Test on various Android versions (API 23+)
5. ✅ Test with different network conditions
6. ✅ Implement proper app lifecycle handling
7. ✅ Add proper logging (remove debug logs in production)
